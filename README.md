angular-translate Pluggable Loader
---

Pluggable Loader is a custom loader for [angular-translate](https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate). It aims to facilitate the modularization of the applications s.t. each module can contribute their own translations and possibly be independent in the kind of angular-translate loader it uses.
